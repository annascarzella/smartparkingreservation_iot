First, install the Wokwi for VS Code extension. Then, press F1 and select "Wokwi: Request a new License". VS Code will ask you confirm opening the Wokwi website in your browser. Confirm by clicking "Open".

Then click on the button that says "GET YOUR LICENSE". You may be asked to sign in to your Wokwi account. If you don't have an account, you can create one for free.

The browser will ask for a confirmation to send the license to VS Code. Confirm (you may have to confirm twice, once in the browser, and once in VS Code). You'll see a message in VS Code that says "License activated for [your name]". Congratulations!
